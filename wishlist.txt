marching algorithm for surface intersection
surfaces of revolution (lathed)
cylinder-line special cases
exact boundaries when near pwl trim
step and repeat rotate/translate
tangent intersections
short pwl edge avoidance
faces
take consistent pwl with coincident faces
exact curve export (at least for dxf)
hidden line removal from mesh
line styles (color, thickness)

-----
loop detection
incremental regen of entities?
